# How I built a Computer Vision Video game | with Opencv, Mediapipe and Python

Creating a video game using Computer Vision, a technology that enables computers to see, understand, and respond to images or videos. They use OpenCV, MediaPipe, and the Python programming language as tools to develop the game. In the related article or tutorial, they may explain the steps involved in building the game, including the basic concepts of using Computer Vision to create interactions within the game.


# Requirement

To create a video game using Computer Vision with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python, you'll need several tools and software:

1. **Python**: The programming language used to write the game code.
2. **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**: An open-source library providing various functions for image and video processing.
3. **MediaPipe**: A library developed by Google for processing sensor data such as images, videos, and distance data.
4. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: Such as PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook, for writing, running, and testing the code.
5. **Webcam or Camera**: To obtain video input from the player.
6. **Hardware**: Such as a computer or laptop that is powerful enough to run the game and process input from the webcam quickly.

By using this combination of tools and software, you can start developing a video game that utilizes Computer Vision technology.
